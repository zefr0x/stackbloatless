## Bug report

For now [GitHub Bug Traker](https://github.com/zefr0x/stackbloatless/issues) is used for this project.

## Development

- The `stable` [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language is used mainly in this project.
- Dependencies managment and building is handled using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/).

### Style

- You should document every thing to keep the code easy for reading. Every file, every function and any line that need a comment.

<!-- TODO: Use pre-commit -->
<!-- #### Setup `pre-commit` -->
<!---->
<!-- To make every thing easy [**`pre-commit`**](https://pre-commit.com/) is used in this project, it should run in every commit, so you shouldn't commit any thing without checking it. -->
<!---->
<!-- First install it: -->
<!---->
<!-- ```shell -->
<!-- pip install pre-commit -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!---->
<!-- > It's better to use you OS's package manager to install it. -->
<!---->
<!-- Then add it as a git hook while you are inside the repository: -->
<!---->
<!-- ```shell -->
<!-- pre-commit install -->
<!-- ``` -->
